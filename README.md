# Dropdown Bug
This repo is to demonstrate an issue I've encountered when trying to use far interaction (right hand only) on a UI dropdown while using Unity 2020.3.19f1 and MRTK 2.7.2.0

**Steps:** 
1. In Build Settings, switch to Universal Windows Platform
2. Build and launch the app on a Hololens 2
3. With the left hand, confirm that the dropdown behaves as expected. Open and sc
roll the dropdown list
4. With the right hand, do the same thing, and notice that the dropdown opens, bu
t when trying to scroll, the dropdown closes
